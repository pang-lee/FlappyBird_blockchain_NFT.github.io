Remake of the Original FlappyBird Using **JS** &amp; **HTML Canvas**  
and use the hardhat as the blockchain backend to create smart contract to generate the Token and NFT  
The Token is follow by the ERC20 standard as for the NFT is follow by ERC1155 (there is also ERC721 standard)  
And we upload our NFT to the IPFS server which is pinata and generate the NFT json file inside blockchain/BirdMetaData/runnerGamejson
